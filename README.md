Background: In today's world, charitable activities are more diverse and prevalent than
ever before, involving a large number of individuals and organizations. However, the
increase in the number of fundraising appeals also means facing the challenge of
transparency and information verification. Charity websites have emerged as an
important bridge between those who call for help and those who want to support. While
it is possible to verify information about the campaign and the fundraiser, there are still
shortcomings such as the inability to track ongoing campaigns, donating is difficult, the
inability to collect feedback from the community, the lack of clear display of campaign
locations, and the lack of visual presentation of funding and donor statistics. At the same
time, verifying the identity of campaign representatives and ensuring that they are
responsible for the proper use of fundraising money is a matter of concern.
Objective: The development of an online fundraising website is to address these
shortcomings. The use of machine learning models will help verify fundraisers, creating
a transparent and secure environment for all stakeholders.
Method: The fundraising website is built on a client-server model, with the frontend
using ReactJS and interface libraries like Bootstrap to create a user-friendly and
aesthetically pleasing interface. The backend is developed on NodeJS and ExpressJS
technology with MongoDB database, integrating the MVC model to build the database
and manage the system. Deep learning models with MTCNN and FaceNet are used to
recognize and verify the identity of the fundraiser through facial verification. Before
posting a campaign, the fundraiser must go through a full verification process to ensure
accuracy and transparency.
Results: The development and deployment of the website has to some extent met the
goal of creating a safer, more reliable, and transparent online charity environment, while
also raising community awareness about the importance of supporting and helping those
in need.
Conclusion: The application of machine learning and facial identity verification in
online fundraising is an important step towards a more sustainable and transparent
online charity community.
